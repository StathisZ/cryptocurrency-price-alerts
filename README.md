Use python to get cryptocurrency price alerts

This is a simple script which uses Telegram messaging service and [IFTTT applets](https://ifttt.com/) to send alerts for a cryptocurrency. It is based on [this article](https://realpython.com/python-bitcoin-ifttt/) and the [Coinmarketcap API](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/). For additional customization of the IFTTT applets, check their documentation [here](https://ifttt.com/docs).
